This project is the first i created fully on my own. It is supposed to take an email account and a specified address, from which the emails are to be shown in a detached desktop app. Also there is the option to save the email as a local file to be read later. If it is a short version of a larger text, that is accessed by a link, both the short and the full version is supposed to be saved locally and can be filtered via a search option.

If this project takes too much time, i'll pause this project and pick it up later on.

Best regards,
